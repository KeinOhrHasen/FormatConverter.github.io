<h1>Edit-Process Raw Data File</h1>

<p>This program reads or creates a raw data (.RW5) file that
contains various lines of data (records) that could be likened to a
surveyor's field book. You can specify point coordinates, job
information, notes, and the angles and distances that make up
traverse or sideshots records. Once the raw data is created or read
it can be processed/reduced to coordinates that are stored in the
current coordinate (.crd; .cgc; .mdb; .zak) file.</p>

<p>The raw file can also be created or appended using the <i>Locate
Point, Traverse, Sideshot</i>, and <i>Inverse</i> commands on the
COGO menu. To store the data inputs from these commands into a raw
file, first toggle on the <i>Raw File ON/OFF</i> command on the
COGO menu. It is possible to always have the raw data file open to
store data inputs. To enable this option, choose Configure from the
Settings menu, then choose Survey Module, then choose General
Settings. Turn on the Automatic Raw File toggle in this dialog.</p>

<p>The raw files created by TDS data collector programs are also
compatible without conversion. The command <i>Data Collectors</i>
on the Tools menu has options for reading other data collectors
native file formats and converting them to raw data (.RW5) format.
Within the raw data editor, the File menu includes an import menu
for converting raw data from other formats.</p>

<p>When you select the <i>Edit-Process Raw Data File</i> command
you are prompted to specify the name of the raw data (.RW5) file.
The current coordinate file is used automatically. To change the
current coordinate file, use the Set Coordinate File command in the
Points menu before starting this command. If no coordinate file is
current, the program will prompt you to set the current coordinate
(.CRD) file.</p>

<p><i>Edit-Process Raw Data File</i> uses a spreadsheet for editing
the raw data as shown. Each row of the spreadsheet is represented
by a number located at the far left side of the editor. Various
messages and reports often reference possible problems with the
data by this row number. Each row of the spreadsheet represents one
record of data. There are 14 types of data records. The type of
data record is shown in the first column. Different record types
use different numbers of columns. Whenever the data record type
changes between rows, a record header is added to the spreadsheet
that describes each column of data in the following row. To edit
the raw data, simply highlight the cell and type in the new value.
To change the type of record, pick on the down arrow in the first
column and choose a new data type from the list. To delete a row,
highlight any cell in the row and hit the Delete key or choose
Delete Row from the Edit menu. Records can be added pressing the
Insert key, pressing the down arrow key from the last line in the
spreadsheet, or by choosing one of the add records from the Add
menu.<br></p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="epr01.png" style=
"width: 668px; height: 604px;">The different record types are
described below.</div>

<p><b><u>TR (Traverse)</u></b><br>
The traverse record contains the occupied point number, foresight
point number, angle mode, horizontal angle, distance, vertical
angle and description. When processed, this record will calculate
and store the coordinates for the foresight point. Traversing also
moves the setup by making the traverse foresight point the next
occupied point and the traverse occupied point becomes the next
backsight point. The different angle codes are NE for northeast
bearing, SE for southeast, SW for southwest, NW for northwest, AZ
for azimuth, AL for angle left, AR for angle right, DL for
deflection angle left and DR for deflection angle right. To set the
angle code, pick on the Code down arrow and choose from the list.
The horizontal and vertical angles should be entered as dd.mmss.
For example, 45.2305 is 45 degrees, 23 minutes and 5 seconds. The
vertical angle can be shown as vertical angle (0 degrees level),
zenith angle (90 degrees level) or elevation difference. The
vertical angle mode is set in the Display menu. The distance mode
is also set in the Display menu as either slope or horizontal
distance. The description field is used as the foresight point
description.</p>

<p><b><u>SS (SideShot)</u></b><br>
The sideshot record is the same as the traverse record except that
sideshot does not move the setup.</p>

<p><b><u>HI (Instrument and Rod Height)</u></b><br>
This record sets the instrument and rod heights used in elevation
calculations. This record should precede any traverse and sideshot
records that you want the heights applied to.</p>

<p><b><u>BK (BackSight)</u></b><br>
The backsight record contains the occupied point number, backsight
point number, backsight azimuth and the set azimuth. This record
should precede any traverse and sideshot records that use this
setup. If no backsight point is entered, the program uses the
backsight azimuth to turn angles from. The Set Azimuth is the
circle reading of the instrument when sighting the backsight. A Set
Azimuth of zero is the default.</p>

<p><b><u>PT (Store Point)</u></b><br>
The store point record consists of a point number, northing,
easting, elevation and description. When processing, this data will
be stored as a point in the coordinate file. If the first Occupied
point and/or the initial Backsight point are not defined in the
coordinate file set for processing to, both points will need to be
added to the rw5 file as PT (Store Point) records.</p>

<p><b><u>DS (Description)</u></b><br>
The description record is an additional note that appears in the
spreadsheet editor and printouts. This record can contain various
information that is recorded in data collectors during field
operations. This data can vary from user, temperature and general
data to each line of data associated with "Set Collection". When
"Sets" of data collected using various brands of data collection
software is converted/imported into the raw editor, the actual
measurements made during the spinning of the angles and distances
are recorded as DS records and the mean value of the angle and
distance is recorded as a SS record. DS records are not used in
processing.</p>

<p><b><u>CL (Closing Shot)</u></b><br>
The closing shot record is the traverse record where the foresight
point is the closing point for the traverse. This record is used by
the adjustment commands in the Process menu. There should be only
one CL record in each Traverse loop (Name Record) in the raw file.
If there is no CL record, the process adjustment routines will
prompt for which shot is the closing shot. The closing shot can
also be define in the field by using special codes defined in the
Open Settings found under the File pulldown within the editor.
Please refer to the "Open Settings" documentation below for more
information on these codes.<br></p>

<p><b><u>AB (Angle Balance)</u></b><br>
The Angle Balance record is the measurement data observed that
closes the angles of the traverse. Typically this record is the
measurement data recorded from the closing shot to the initial
backsight point. The backsight could be either external or internal
to the traverse. Angle Balance routine in the Process menu uses
this record and compares the angle between the occupied point and
foresight point of this record with a user-specified reference
angle. There should be only one AB record in the raw file. If there
is no AB record, then the Angle Balance routine will prompt for
which shot to use as the angle balance.</p>

<p><b><u>CL + AB (Closing Shot and Angle Balance)</u></b><br>
This record is used as both the closing shot and angle balance
records.</p>

<p><b><u>FD (Foresight Direct)</u></b><br>
The foresight direct is a traverse record used in a direct and
reverse set. When the program finds one the of direct-reverse
measurement records, it will look for the other three records to
complete the set.</p>

<p><b><u>FR (Foresight Reverse)</u></b><br>
The foresight reverse is a traverse record used in a direct and
reverse set.</p>

<p><b><u>BD (Backsight Direct)</u></b><br>
The backsight direct is a traverse record used in a direct and
reverse set.</p>

<p><b><u>BR (Backsight Reverse)</u></b><br>
The backsight reverse is a traverse record used in a direct and
reverse set. <b><u><br></u></b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">EL
(Elevation Only)</span><br>
This record sets the elevation in the CRD file for the specified
point number. Often used when an existing point with good vertical
control is being traversed through. Using this record type for the
point would keep the elevation from changing on the existing point
regardless of the measurement data.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">AZ
(Azimuth Only)</span><br>
Applies to SurvNET, the optional Network Least Squares analysis and
adjustment routine.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">CSE

adjustment routine.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">MSE
(Measurement Standard Error)</span><br>
Applies to SurvNET, the optional Network Least Squares analysis and
adjustment routine.<br></p>

<p><b><u>NAME (Traverse Name)</u></b><br>
This record acts as an identifier for the group of records that
make up a traverse. All the records after the NAME record belong to
that traverse up to the next NAME record or the end of the file.
This record allows you to have multiple traverses in one raw file.
When running one of the Process commands, the program will bring up
a list of all the traverse names. Simply choose which traverse to
process. If you have only one traverse in the raw file, then you
don't need the NAME record.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">GPS</span></span><br>
This record contains the Latitude and Longitude of a point as
measured by GPS surveying equipment using Carlson SurvCE data
collection software. This record has additional information tied to
it such as localization files, geoid files, coordinate projection
systems etc. This record has its own processing routine in the
Process pulldown within the editor. Processing procedures are
discussed in the Process (Compute Pts) pulldown
documentation.<br></p>

These routines convert raw data from other formats into the current
Carlson RW5 format. The converted raw data will be added to the end
of any existing data in the editor. In many cases, the raw data
file to import can be downloaded directly from the data collector
or instrument using the <i>Data Collectors</i> command. The
following supported formats (along with their standard file
extension) are listed here. Some Sample File Formats are listed at
the end of this section.

"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Angles:</span></b>This
option chooses the angle format between degrees/minutes/seconds
(dd.mmss) and Gons-400 decimal degree circle (dd.dddd). This
setting applies to the angles in the spreadsheet editor as well as
the angle format for reports. There is also a separate setting to
Show Decimal Seconds which use edit and process angles to the
nearest tenth of a second (dd.mmsss).<br></p>

<p><b><span style=
"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Vertical:</span></b>The
options contained in this menu allow for specifying the type of
vertical measurement information you will input or is contained in
the rw5 file. The Vertical Angle selection assumes the barrel or
scope of the instrument is level when reading 0 (zero). With this
setting, the vertical component of a measurement record will have a
header of VertAng. The Zenith Angle selection, most commonly used,
assumes the barrel/scope to be level when reading 90. Using this
setting results in a header of ZenithAng. Elevation difference
displays the elevation difference between the occupied and
foresight points. If the Distance option is specified as Slope,
this elevation difference will be used to calculate the horizontal
distance of the measurement. The header for this record is
ElevDiff. The None selection assumes all distances are horizontal
distances and removes the vertical component for a measurement from
the editor. Switching modes can be performed at any time.</p>

This option controls the display of either Slope or Horizontal
Distances. Changing the display results in the distance data
adjusting to reflect the correct value for the selection made. The
Vertical data, VertAng, ZenithAng or VertDiff, is used to convert
the distance value when changing this display option.<br></div>

COGO Command:</span> Adds COGO Command (CC) record with a field to
specify the command (Translate, Rotate, Scale or Align) and a field
for entering the parameters. The COGO commands are executed in
sequence as the rw5 file is processed from top to bottom by any of
the process methods in the Process menu. The COGO commands are all
transformation commands that are applied to the points in the
current coordinate file. The following list is the syntax of the

Note:</span> Adds a note (DS) record to the editor. Note records
are for information display and do not affect processing except for
two special notes which are:<br>
Elevation: 2D<br>
Elevation: 3D<br>
These special notes set the elevation mode for processing for the
records that follow the note. The raw editor starts in 3D mode. The
"Elevation: 2D" note will switch processing to 2D mode and the
"Elevation: 3D" note will switch the mode back to 3D. In 2D mode,
the processing will not set the elevations in the coordinate
file.<br></p>

<p><span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">
Data On/Off:</span> Adds a data on/off (DO) record to the editor.
This record toggles the raw data between processing on and off
modes. The raw data starts in processing on mode. Working from top
to down, when a DO record is reached, the processing mode is turned
off. Then next DO record will turn processing back on, and so on.
Data records that are in processing off mode and skipped when
running the routines in the Process menu.<br></p>

<p><b>Process (Compute Pts) Menu</b><br>
This menu contains tools to process raw data by various methods.
The calculated coordinates, and notes if specified, are stored to
the active specified coordinate file. The coordinate file can be
specified using <span style="font-style: italic;">Set Coordinate
File,</span> under the Points pulldown within the drawing screen,
or from the Tools menu of the editor, discussed later in this
section. The options for processing are specified within either the
Process Options dialog box or the Closure Options dialog box,
depending upon . This dialog box is displayed before processing
data, using any of the available methods, with the exception being
the Least Squares method.<br></p>

<p><img alt="" src="ep40.PNG" style=
"width: 123px; height: 209px;"><img alt="" src="dialog1.bmp" style=
"width: 444px; height: 495px;"><b>Multiple Measurements To Same
Point:</b> This option sets the method of how to handle multiple
measurements to the same point. There are three available options,
Use Last, Average or Use First. Use last uses the last measurement
to calculate the position of the point. Average uses the average of
all the measurements for the position calculation and Use Last
takes the last measurement to the point as the data to use.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use Backsight
Reciprocals:</span> The Backsight Reciprocal options treat
reciprocal measurements "special". A foresight to point 15 from a
setup on 14, followed by a backsight from 15 to 14, makes a pair of
"reciprocal" measurements. The backsight "reciprocal" measurement
can be ignored for its impact on recalculating the occupied point
(None Option), or the elevation of component of the reciprocal
measurements can be averaged (Average Elevation option), or both
the elevation and distance can be averaged (Average Elev &amp;
Dist) to recalculate the setup (occupied point)
coordinates.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculate Elevations:</span>
This option determines whether the elevations of the points will be
calculated and written to the coordinate file. Options of whether
to calculate All elevations or just the Sideshots Only are
provided.<br></p>

<p><b>Direct-Reverse Vertical Angles:</b> Specify whether to
balance all or process the direct-reverse shots and use only the
foresight direct shot.</p>

<p><b>Report Angle Format:</b> Specifies the angle format for the
report. The By File option makes the report use the angle format in
the raw data (.RW5) file.</p>

<p><b>Calculate Elevations:</b> This option controls which point
elevations will be calculated. For example, if the traverse point
elevations have already been adjusted and you need to recalculate
the sideshot elevations, then use the SideShots Only option.</p>

<p><b>Report SideShots:</b> Specify whether to include the sideshot
data in the process results report.</p>

<p><b>Point Protect:</b> This option will check the coordinate
(.CRD) file for existing point data before processing. If the
foresight point number for any traverse or sideshot record already
is a stored coordinate in the coordinate (.CRD) file, then the
program shows a list of conflicting point numbers. You can either
continue processing and overwrite the coordinate (.CRD) file
coordinates with the calculated raw file coordinates or cancel the
processing to go back to the editor to change foresight
numbers.<br></p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="ep32.PNG" style=
"width: 450px; height: 456px;">A report of the conflicting point
numbers can be generated to the standard report viewer in Carlson
by selecting the Report option on the Point Protect dialog box.
From the report viewer, the report can then be printed, sent to the
screen or saved to a file.<br></div>

<p><img alt="" src="ep33.PNG" style=
"width: 800px; height: 398px;"><b>Create Point Notes:</b> This
option will generate a note (.NOT) file named after the coordinate
file. The note file contains additional descriptions for points.
With this option active, the text from all note records (DS
records) will be stored to the note file for the foresight point
number preceding the note records.<br></p>

<p><b>Calculate Grid Scale Factor at Each Setup:</b> This option
will calculate a scale factor for each TR and SS record. This scale
factor is calculated as the average of the scale factors at the
occupied and foresights points. At these points the scale factor is
calculated as the projection grid factor multiplied by the
elevation factor which is the earth radius divided by the elevation
plus the earth radius [SF = Grid Factor * (Earth Radius /
(Elevation + Earth Radius))]. In order to calculate these
projection grid factors, the traverse coordinates must be in grid
coordinates. When this option is selected, the program will prompt
for the projection and zone to use. The elevation for the scale
factor can be adjusted by the geoid height using the geoid
specified in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Geoid To
Apply</span> list. The geoid height is added to the point elevation
to adjust the elevation value used in the scale factor equation.
The geoid surface files are not installed by default due to the
large size of these files. To install the geoids to use with this
option, go to the Carlson Software webpage and download the Geoid
Grid Files from the Support-&gt;Downloads section.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Report Each State Plane
Scale:</span> This option becomes available if the Calculate State
Plane Factor at Each Setup has been selected. With this option on,
the scale factor at each point will be shown in the process results
report.<br></p>

<p><b>Scale Factor:</b> This value is multiplied by the horizontal
distance for the traverse and sideshot records. This factor can be
use to transform from ground to grid coordinates. This factor does
not affect elevations.<br></p>

<p><b>Correct for Earth Curvature:</b> This option adjusts the
calculated points for the effect of the Earth's curvature.
Typically this adjustment is small and adjusts the elevation more
than the horizontal.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Report Angle Format<span style=
"font-style: italic;">:</span></span></span> This option controls
the angle format displayed on the process result report. The option
of <span style="font-weight: bold;">By Raw File</span> will display
the angles in the format that is contained in the raw file. The
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bearing</span> option will display
the angle in a bearing format. The <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Azimuth</span> option will display the azimuth
of the measurement and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Angle
Right</span> option will display the angle right measurement of the
observation.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Decimal Places for
Report:</span> This option controls the number of decimal places
for the reported data.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Report Closure:</span> This
option determines whether the closure report will be displayed
after processing. If processing a topo survey where the traverse
has not been closed, then turn this toggle off for quick
processing..<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Report Sideshots:</span>
Controls whether the sideshot data is shown on the process
report.<br></p>

<p><b>Reference Closing Point:</b> This is an optional field for
entering the coordinates to compare the ending traverse point with.
This reference closing point is used to calculate the closure.
Without using this option the program will by default use the
starting coordinate as the reference closing point.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Report Output:</span> There are
three report output options contained in the raw editor, the
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Standard
Report Viewer</span>, the <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Custom Report
Formatter</span> and the <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Tabular Report
Viewer</span>. Each is documented below.<br></p>

<p>The <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Standard Report
Viewer</span> is the default report viewer throughout the program.
Any routine that generates a report has this option and the data
contained in the report depends upon the routine executed. The
report viewer is also a text editor. It allows for addition and
deletion of text in order to customize the report for printing or
for saving to a particular format for a file. Options to print,
send to the screen in the drawing window as text or save to a file
are available.<br></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="ep34.PNG" style=
"width: 925px; height: 659px;">
</p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Custom
Report Formatter</span> allows for customization of the process
results by selecting the fields and the layout of the fields to
display. The settings can be saved to a format name and recalled
when needed. Options to Delete, Export and Import saved Formats are
also available.<br></p>

<p><img alt="" src="ep35.PNG" style="width: 840px; height: 636px;">
To create a report, select data from the Available list and then
select the Add button. This will populate the Used field with the
selected data. Standard window selection methods can be used when
selecting the data to report. Holding the ctrl key while selecting
data allows for making random selections. Holding the shift key
while selecting data will select the first item picked, last item
picked and all items between.<br></p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Tabular
Report Viewer</span> displays a report viewer consisting of tabs.
Each tab organizes and displays different data depending upon the
process option chosen. The process results using the No Adjust
method results in three tabs the Report Header, Unadjusted Data and
the Store Points tabs. Each of these tabs display different
information which corresponds to the tab title. Using an adjustment
method results in five tabs. In addition to the three listed above,
an Angle Balance and Compass Closure tab is added. From the Tabular
Report Viewer, the Standard Report Viewer can be switched to by
pressing the Report option at the bottom of the dialog. This is
useful when wanting to combine all tabs into one report for
printing or saving to a file. An example of a Tabular Report for a
compass rule adjustment is shown below.<br></p>

<p><img alt="" src="ep47.PNG" style=
"width: 880px; height: 654px;"><span style=
"font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Processing
Methods</span><br>
</p>

<p><b><span style="font-style: italic;">No Adjust:</span></b> No
Adjust means that no angle balance or traverse adjustment will be
applied. Options are specified in the Process Options dialog. After
picking OK for the process options dialog, a Traverse Points dialog
appears for entering the starting and ending point numbers.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="ep48.PNG" style="width: 344px; height: 184px;">
The program reads the raw file to set the defaults for these point
numbers which are used to calculate the closure. The difference
between the ending point and the reference closing point is the
closure error and the sum of the traverse distances from the
starting to the ending point is used as the total distance
traversed. After picking OK for the second dialog, the program
starts processing the raw file from the top record down. The result
is displayed in the Standard Report Viewer which can save, print or
draw the report.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><b style="font-style: italic;">Angle
Balance:</b> This process method applies an angle balance to the
traverse lines when calculating the coordinates. The angle balance
takes the angular error divided by the number of traverse lines and
adjusts the angle of each traverse line by this amount. The angular
error is the difference between the angle balance shot and a
reference angle. The angle balance shot is specified as a type AB
or CL+AB record in the raw file. If no AB record is found in the
raw file, then the program will prompt for which traverse shot to
use as the angle balance shot. The angle from the angle balance
shot is calculated as the angle from the occupied point to the
foresight point. The reference angle can be specified as a bearing,
azimuth or by two point numbers in the dialog shown.<br></div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="ep49.PNG" style=
"width: 396px; height: 256px;">
</p>

<p>The angle balance report shows the unadjusted points, the
unadjusted closure, the angular error, the adjusted points and then
the adjusted closure. Typically but not always, applying the angle
balance correction will improve the traverse closure.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Compass,
Crandall, Transit:</span> These process methods apply the selected
rule to the traverse lines when calculating the coordinates. After
adjusting the traverse, the sideshots are also recalculated. The
closure error is calculated as the difference between the closing
shot and a reference point. The closing shot is specified as a type
CL or CL+AB record in the raw file. If no CL record is found in the
raw file, then the program will prompt for which traverse shot to
use as the closing shot. The foresight point is used as the closing
coordinate. The reference point can be specified by point number or
by entering the northing, easting and elevation. The process
results report shows the unadjusted points, closure error,
adjustments to each traverse point and adjusted point.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Prepare
Least Squares Data:</span> From the raw file data, this routine
makes initial calculations for the coordinate points in the
traverse.<br></p>
<img alt="" src="ep61.png" style=
"width: 589px; height: 296px;">This data, along with the control
point coordinates and the angle and distance measurements, is
stored to a data file with the same name as the current RW5 file
except with a .LSQ extension (ie: survey.lsq goes with survey.rw5).
The constraints of the routine are:<br>

<div style="text-align: left;">
</div>

<p style="text-align: left;"><b>All angle readings must be in angle
right mode.</b>
</p>

<p><b>The coordinates of the starting and the ending points must be
known.</b>
</p>

<p>The routine begins with a dialog for specifying the reference
closing coordinates and any scale factors to apply to the distance
measurements. The Reference Closing Point is the last point in the
traverse, whose coordinates must be known. If an angle balance shot
is used in the traverse, the Reference Angle Balance Angle must
also be specified, either as a value or as the angle between known
points.</p>

<p>Since angles and distances have errors of different magnitudes,
they are normalized using weights, based on the accuracy and
confidence with which these quantities have been measured. There is
a dialog for specifying the estimated measurement errors. The
Reading Error is the horizontal angular error in the instrument.
For example, for a "5-second" instrument this error would be 5. The
Pointing Error accounts for several factors in the horizontal angle
reading including accuracy lining up the crosshairs on the target,
the target size and the optical quality of the instrument. The
Target and Instrument Centering Errors are the distance off the
point due to faulty centering. The EDM Constant Error is the
accuracy of the instrument distance measurements. The EDM Scaler
Error is entered in parts per million for the increased error in
longer measurements. These settings can be saved and loaded as a
way to store settings for different equipment.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="03-0H213.bmp" align=
"bottom">
</p>

<p>The program will calculate the weights for each distance and
angle measurement using these measurement errors. The control
points, points to adjust, distance and angle measurements with
weights are reported. You can edit these measurements and weights
using the Edit Least-Squares Data routine or go directly to the
Process Least-Squares Data routine.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Edit Least
Squares Data:</span> This routine edits the points, measurements
and weights stored in the .LSQ file associated with the current RW5
file. The editor works through the dialog shown. You can edit, add
or remove the control points, adjust points, angle measurements or
distance measurements. The program does not check that the editing
is valid. So you need to make sure that your changes keep a good
set of least-squares data (i.e. don't delete a needed control
point). The Distance Error button allows you to set the distance
standard error weights for all the distance measurements to the
same value. Likewise the Angle Error button sets the standard error
weights for all the angle measurements.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Process Least Squares Data</b><br>
This routine applies a least-squares adjustment to the data stored
in the .LSQ associated with the current raw data (.RW5) file. The
closing errors are distributed among the other points, using the
"Method of Least Squares" (Ref : Wolf, P.R. and Ghilani, C.D.,
1996, "Adjustment Computations", John Wiley and Sons, NY,Third
Edition). After the adjustment, the rest of the raw file is
processed to recalculate the sideshots. There is an option to draw
standard error ellipses around the adjusted points. The ellipse
axes are multiplied by Ellipse Scale Factor to make the ellipse
larger for easier viewing.<br></p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="ep50.PNG" style=
"width: 517px; height: 250px;">
</div>

<p>The least-squares process report shows the input data and the
results. For each point, the amount adjusted and the standard error
in X and Y are reported. The Reference Standard Deviation is based
on the sum of the residuals and the initial estimated standard
errors. The Chi-Squares test is a goodness-of-fit test that checks
the reference standard deviation with the least-squares model. If
this test fails, there may be a blunder in the measurement data or
the initial estimated standard errors were too low or too
high.<br></p>

<p><b>Stadia Processing Method<i>:</i></b> Provides functionality
to process Stadia surveying notes. Stadia sighting depends on two
horizontal cross-hairs, known as stadia hairs, within the
telescope. These hairs are parallel to the horizontal cross-hair
and are equally spaced above and below it. The distance between the
two stadia hairs is known as the intercept. The distance from the
instrument to the rod is 100 times the intercept. For example, an
intercept of 3.10 would represent a distance of 310 (3.10 X 100).
For entering in stadia notes, you would enter the horizontal angle,
the distance (entered as the intercept X 100) and the vertical
angle.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS:</span> The process GPS
routine allows for reduction of GPS records that reside in a raw
(*.RW5) file from latitude, longitude and WGS84 Ellipsoid Height to
State Plane or local coordinates. When selected, the GPS Settings
dialog will appear as shown below.<br></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="ep51.PNG" style=
"width: 489px; height: 406px;">
</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS&gt;Projection
Type:</span><br>
Defines the datum coordinate system to be used for converting the
latitude, Longitude and WGS84 Ellipsoid height collected from the
GPS receiver into Cartesian coordinates. The supported projection
types are State Plane 83, State Plane 27, UTM, Lat/Long, Great
Britain-OSGB36, Australia, New Zealand-NZGD2000, New
Zealand-NZGD49, and France NTF-GR3DF97A. A User-Defined option is
also available for defining a user projection.<br></p>

<p>The supported geoids include: Geoid99 (USA), Geoid03 (USA),
EGM96 (World), GDA94 (Australia), CGG2000, HT 2.0, HT HT 1.01
(Canada) and )SGM02 (Britain). GeoUser-Defined projections are
supported. To define a new projection select the Define Projection
option. This will bring up the following dialog.<br></p>

<p><img alt="" src="ep60.PNG" style="width: 862px; height: 488px;">
Enter a name for your system (e.g. PRVI for Puerto Rico/Virgin
Islands), then select a Projection type and enter the appropriate
parameters. Note that all latitude and longitude values are in
Degrees Minutes and Seconds (dd.mmss) and False Northing and False
Eastings are always presented in meters. Define a Datum shift by
selecting the Select Datum radial button. You may select a
predefined Ellipsoid or set your own parameters by typing in a new
ellipsoid name in the Ellipsoid field and entering values for a and
1/f. When you enter in a new Ellipsoid name, the Datum name field
will be blank. The values for Dx, Dy, Dz, Rx, Ry, and Rz and scale
are "to WGS84". If the values you have are "from WGS84", simply
reverse the sign of each value (positive becomes negative and vice
versa).<br></p>

<p>You may save your system to a "udp" file. To Load a user defined
coordinate system from a file, select the Load radial button. A
list of user defined systems will be displayed. Select the desired
system and press OK.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS&gt;Zone:</span> for State
Plane projections, you must select the correct state zone that you
are working in. For UTM, the Automatic Zone option will have the
program automatically user the program automatically use the
correct UTM zone for your location. Otherwise for UTM, you can
manually set a specific UTM zone. This manual option applies to
working on the border between zones and you want to force the
program to always use one of those zones.<br style=
"font-weight: bold;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS&gt;Use Alignment File For
Localization:</span> With this option toggle on, a prompt for the
Alignment File to Process will be displayed. This file is typically
created by SurvCE (Carlson's Data Collection System) using the
Localization routine or by Carlson Field Using the Align to Local
Coordinates routine. This file (*.DAT) contains the parameters to
transform the derived State Plane coordinates to the defined local
coordinates.<br></p>

<p>At the end of the process, the coordinates will be written to
the current coordinate (*.crd) file and a report will be presented
in the Carlson editor for saving or printing purposes.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS&gt;Transformation:</span>
The transformation in the align Local Coordinates command can
either be by plane similarity or rigid body methods. The difference
is that the rigid body method does a transformation with a
translation and rotation and without a scale The plane similarity
does a rotation, translation and scale. This option only applies
when two or more points are used in Align Local Coordinates or the
Localization routine in SurvCE.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS&gt;One Point Alignment
Azimuth:</span> This option applies to the rotation when using one
point in Align Local Coordinates or the Localization routine in
SurvCE. For this alignment method, the state plane coordinate is
translated to the local coordinate. Then the rotation can use
either the state plane grid or the geodetic as north. No scale is
applied in this transformation. The state plane and geodetic true
north diverge slightly in the east and west edges of the state
plane zone. This option allows you to choose which north to
use.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS&gt;Two Point Alignment
Method:</span> There are two option when using this method, Fit
&amp; Rotate and Rotate Only. Fit &amp; Rotate will use the second
point in the localization file for direction and scaling. The
Rotate Only option allows you to use the second point in the
localization file for direction but not for scaling. When using the
Rotate Only option, any scale factor entered in the Project Scale
Factor will be used.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS&gt;Project Scale
Factor:</span> For most applications, the Scale Factor should be
set to 1.0. The scale factor represents the “combined”
grid/elevation factor that reduces ground distances to grid. After
converting the LAT/LONG from the GPS records to state plane
coordinates and applying the coordinate alignment (Localization)
file, the Project Scale Factor is applied as the final adjustment
to the coordinates. This adjustment is used on the X, Y, and not
the Z. The Project Scale Factor is applied by dividing the distance
between the coordinate and a base point by the Project Scale
Factor. The coordinate is then set by starting from the base point
and moving in the direction to the coordinate for the adjusted
distance. The base point is the first point in the alignment
(Localization) file. If there are no points specified in the
alignment file, then 0,0 is used as the base point. If using an
alignment file (Localization File) this value will be automatically
calculated and displayed. Manual entry of a scale factor is also
permitted and is often used with the Two Point Alignment Method
when a scale factor is known.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS&gt;Geoid to Apply:</span>
The supported geoids include: Geoid99 (USA), Geoid03 (USA), EGM96
(World), GDA94 (Australia), CGG2000, HT 2.0, HT HT 1.01 (Canada)
and SGM02 (Britain).</p>

<p>This option will account for the geoid undulation in determining
the orthometric elevation of the measurement. The definition of the
geoid model as currently adopted by the national Geodetic survey is
the equipotential surface of the Earth's gravity field which best
fits, in a least squares sense, global mean sea level. Orthometric
elevation measurements are used in survey calculations. In order to
convert ellipsoid heights (He) as measured by GPS into orthometric
elevations (E0), you must provide for a correction between the
GPS-measured ellipsoid (reference ellipsoid) and a constant level
gravitational surface, the geoid. This corrections is the geoid
undulation (Ug). The formula is He=Eo + Ug.<br></p>

<p>Carlson applies the Geoid model by subtracting the Geoid
undulation from the GPS elevation. The resulting elevation is then
used and displayed. In practice, the Geoid model is most applicable
to two types of alignment scenarios. One of these types is when
setting up the base over a known point and having no alignment
control points. The other is when there is one alignment control
point. When using multiple alignment control points, the Geoid
model is not as important because Carlson can model the elevation
difference which can generally pick up the local Geoid
undulation.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS&gt;Units:</span>
Coordinates can be reduced into one of three available units,
Metric, US Feet or International Feet.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Process&gt;Process
Settings:</span> This option allows for the setting of user
preferences and tolerances to be used during processing and
generation of reports.<br></p>

<p><img alt="" src="dialog2.bmp"><span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Multiple Measurement Settings<span style=
"font-style: italic;">:</span></span> These options provide control
for managing how multiple measurements to the same point are
handled and reported.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Distance
Tolerance Horizontal and Vertical:</span> Allows for user input of
desired tolerance values for multiple measurements. Exceeded
tolerances will be displayed on the process results report. With
the Report Residuals option ON, the residual values of the
measurements will be shown on the process results report.<br>
The data to be averaged can be either the <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Distance Measurements</span> or the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Coordinates</span>.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Backsight Orientation
Settings:</span> The <i><b>Override Backsight Azimuth When Have
Backsight Coordinate File</b></i> applies to BK records that have
both a backsight point number and backsight azimuth. When this
option is on and the backsight point is found in the coordinate
file, then the backsight orientation is set to the angle from the
occupy point to the backsight point. Otherwise the backsight
azimuth is used. The <i><b>Use Multiple References</b></i> option
will take multiple backsight measurements for an occupation and
computes a least squares orientation for the instrument. There is
also an option to compute and correct for the instrumental
collimation error from the available measurements if both direct
and reverse readings to one or more stations in the same set have
been recorded. The program uses the BD (backsight direct) and BR
(backsight reverse) records to identify the measurements to
process. You can backsight different targets. The targets do need
to have known coordinates either as points in the current
coordinate file or as SP records in the raw file. The measurements
can be complete with angles and distance, and they can be partial
with only angles or only distance. When this option is active, the
calculated backsight orientation will override the SetAzi field in
the BK (backsight) record for the setup. The process report will
include all the measurements used, the residuals and the resulting
backsight orientation. The least-squares routine will also
calculate the occupied station coordinate by resection if possible
from the measurements and the report includes this calculated
position along with the reference position and residuals. This
calculation of the occupy point is used only for a check for the
report and does not affect the occupy coordinate for processing.
Note that if the occupied station position is unknown, there must
be sufficient measurements to at least three known reference
stations to support the resection and orientation solution. Here is
an example of the raw data and the report.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check Point Settings:</span>
These options provide user controls for survey check points. With
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Report Check
Points</span> ON, any point coded as a check point in the raw data
file, will be reported. When selected the <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Check Point Code</span>
and Distance Tolerance fields become active and allow for editing.
The <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Check
Point Code</span> is a user specified code entered in during the
survey that tells the program to check the coordinates of a
particular point with the coordinates of another point. This code
is configurable by the user. An example of a point description
coded as a Check Point would be as such, "trav =8". This
description tells the program that the description of the point is
"trav" and to check the coordinates of the this point with that of
point #8. The <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Distance Tolerance
Horizontal</span> and <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Vertical</span> are user
specified tolerances for the check point. If either of these
tolerances is exceeded it will be reported on the process results
report.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instrument/Rod Height
Ranges:</span> These settings are used to check the instrument and
rod heights when the raw file is processed. The program will report
warnings if there are any heights that exceed the specified min/max
ranges.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Angle Only Measurements:</span>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Combine Elevations
Method</span> applies to points calculated from Angle Only
measurements. Angle Only points are calculated as part of the
processing for the No Adjust, Compass, Crandall, Transit and Angle
Balance process methods. To calculate points from Angle Only
measurements, there needs to be multiple SS records with horizontal
and vertical angles and no distance with the same target foresight
point number from setups at different occupy points. The elevations
can be set as the average from the multiple measurements, using the
highest measured elevation, or using the lowest measured elevation.
For example, to survey the top of a tree, you could have a SS to
foresight point 99 from occupy point 1 with a horizontal and
vertical angle and another SS to foresight point 99 from occupy
point 2 with a horizontal and vertical angle. Then point 99 can be
calculated by angle-angle intersect which determines the horizontal
distances from 99 back to occupy points 1 and 2. These distances
are then used with the vertical angles and occupy point elevation
to calculate the elevation at point 99.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Store Point Records:</span>
These options control how any store point (PT) record is handled
during processing of the raw data file. There are three options for
storing Store Point (PT) records, <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Never</span>, <span style=
"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Always</span>, and
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">When CRD
Empty</span>. <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Never</span> prevents any
Store Point (PT) Record Report in the raw file from being written
to the crd file. With this option on no existing point in the crd
file would be overwritten. <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Always</span> will write
to the coordinate file and will overwrite any existing point with
the same number of the Store Point (PT) records. The <span style=
"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">When CRD Empty</span>
option will only write Store Point (PT) records to the coordinate
file when it is empty. <span style=
"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Report Store Points</span>
displays all store points in the process results report. The
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Hold Store
Points</span> option will hold the coordinate values for the store
point record when measurements are taken to the store points. This
will prevent the coordinates of the point from changing if
measurements to the point dictate a change in coordinate
position.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Direct-Reverse Settings:</span>
</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Direct-Reverse Vertical
Angles</span><span style=
"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">:</span> This option
determines how to handle direct-reverse vertical angle measurements
when processing. <span style=
"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Balance
Direct-Reverse</span> will take the mean of the direct-reverse
measurements and use this value when processing the file.
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Direct
Only</span> will only use the direct measurement to the point for
processing.<br></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Foresight-Backsight Measurements:
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Balance Foresight-Backsight
allows for averaging in the Foresight and backsight measurements
when using direct-reverse sets. The Foresight Only option will
average the foresight measurements only of a direct-reverse
set.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></span></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style=
"font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Horizontal
Angle Tolerance (Seconds):</span> This is the tolerance that the
angle measured by the direct measurements and the angle measured by
the reverse measurements in a direct-reverse set must fall
within.<br></span>
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style=
"font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flip Angle
Tolerance (Seconds):</span> User specified value for the acceptable
difference in measured horizontal angles determined from the direct
(BD-FD) and reverse (BR-FR) observations.<br></span>
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style=
"font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Distance
Tolerance:</span> User specified tolerance for the difference in
distance measurements to the same points. When this value is
exceeded on a measurement, it will be displayed on the process
results report.<br></span>
</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Measurements To Control
Points:</span> The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Store To
Current Coordinate File</span> option applies when a control
coordinate file is used in addition to the active coordinate file.
When processing the raw file, measurements to point numbers that
are in the control coordinate file will not be stored into the
active coordinate file when this option is on.<br></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style=
"font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Drawing
Points and Linework:</span> This option controls the drawing of
points and linework using Field to Finish. It differs from the draw
traverse and sideshot lines under the Tools Menu of the Raw Editor
by using a field to finish code table (*.fld) to define how the
points and linework are to be drawn and layerized. There are three
settings for this option, Manual, Auto and Prompt. Manual means
that the file will not be processed using the field to finish codes
and no points or linework with be drawn upon existing the raw
editor. The Auto option will use the current or last used field to
finish file (*.fld) to draw the points and lines on the drawing
screen when the raw editor is existed. The option of Prompt will
give the option to draw the points and lines to the screen. With
this setting specified, the following prompt will be displayed when
existing the editor.<br></span>
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"><span style=

<p><img alt="" src="ep58.PNG" style=
"width: 237px; height: 243px;"><b><span style=
"font-style: italic;">Direct-Reverse Report</span>:</b> This
routine creates a report of direct and reverse shots along with the
resulting averaged shots. Any tolerance specified in the Process
Settings&gt;Direct-Reverse Settings section, that is exceeded will
be displayed in this report. The residuals are the difference
between the measurement and the final average. If the current
spreadsheet display mode for distances is set to horizontal, then
the report will show horizontal distances. Otherwise, the report
uses slope distances.<br></p>

<p><b><span style="font-style: italic;">Reduce
Direct-Reverse:</span></b> This routine processes the direct and
reverse shots and simplifies the raw file by replacing the sets of
direct and reverse shots with the resulting average traverse
record.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-style: italic;">Update Raw from
Points:</span></b> This routine is used to update the raw data
based upon the coordinates of the points contained in the
coordinate (*.crd) file. For example if the raw data has been
processed using the compass rule adjustment method, the points in
the crd file are now adjusted. However the raw data remains
unchanged. If a record of the rw5 file reflecting the angles and
distances between the points after an adjustment has been ran is
desired, this routine can be run thus updating the raw data to
reflect the adjusted angles and distances. Another application for
this routine is that of building a rw5 file for future processing
and adjustment. For example if a point file or text file has been
received from another engineering firm or fellow surveyor and you
would like to build a rw5 file for future reference and processing
this option can also be used to accomplish this. The rw5 file would
be set up with the occupied points, foresight points and the
desired angle type to use specified for the traverse. This would be
all the manual entry of the data necessary. After creating the
"shell" of the traverse then run the update raw from points routine
and the raw data, as contained in the coordinate file, will be
imported into the rw5 file thus filling out the horizontal angle,
distance and vertical components specified.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Find Bad Angle:</span> This
routine applies the angular error to each traverse record one at a
time. The adjusted traverse record that improves the closure the
most is reported as the Bad Angle. The angular error is the
difference between the angle balance shot and a reference
angle.<br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Append Another Raw File:</span>
This routine prompts for another raw data (.RW5) file which is read
and the data added to the end of the existing raw data (.RW5) file.
For example, if you are editing the raw file from the first days
work and have a separate raw file with a second days work, you can
use this routine to add the second raw data to the first raw
file.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Draw
Traverse-Sideshot Lines:</span> This routine draws lines for all
the traverse and sideshot records. Sideshot Traverses are traverses
that do not lead to the closing or ending point. There are
different layers so that the lines can be drawn with different
colors. This command does not process the raw file. Instead it
reads the raw file and for each traverse and sideshot record, the
program looks up the coordinates for the occupied and foresight
points in the CRD file. So it may be necessary to run Process&gt;No
Adjust before running this routine. With the Erase Previous
Traverse-Sideshot Lines toggled on, any previous linework drawn
using this method will be erased from the drawing screen before
drawing the lines again.<br></p>

<p><img alt="" src="ep57.PNG" style=
"width: 415px; height: 196px;"><b><span style=
"font-style: italic;">Renumber Points:</span></b> This routine
renumbers points in the raw file. This applies to all point numbers
including: TR, SS, and PT records.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="03-0H217.bmp" align=
"bottom">
</p>

<p><b>Range of Points to Renumber:</b> Enter in the range of points
to change, ie 1-4.</p>

<p><b>Line Number to Begin Renumbering:</b> This corresponds to the
line number located at the far left or the raw data editor. Enter
the line number to begin the renumbering.</p>

<p><b>Line Number To End Renumbering:</b> This also corresponds to
the line number located at the far left on the raw data editor.
Enter the line number to end the renumbering. If the range of
numbers specified does not occur between the beginning line number
and the ending line number, no changes will be made.</p>

<p><b>Numbers to Add to Point Numbers:</b> Enter in the value to
add. This number will be added to the existing point number to
create the new point number. For example, if the number to add is
10 and the existing point numbers 1 and 6, the new renumber points
will be 11 and 16.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><br>
Point Groups:</span> This option can be used to organize the survey
data into point groups. There are three options for the creation of
point groups, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create All Point
Group</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create Traverse
Point Group</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create
Sideshot Point Group</span>. The <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">Create All Point Group</span> option, creates
a user specified group containing all of the points defined in the
rw5 file. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create Traverse Point
Group</span> creates a user specified group containing only the
points defined in the traverse records (TR) of the rw5 file. The
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Create Sideshot Point Group</span>
creates a user specified group that contains only the points
defined in the sideshot records (SS) of the rw5 file.</p>

<p><b>Format of the raw data (.RW5) file</b>
</p>
The Carlson raw data format is a comma delimited ASCII file
containing record types, headers, recorded data and comments. The
format is based on the RW5 raw data specification, with the
exception of angle sets. Angle sets are recorded as BD, BR, FD and
FR records to allow reduction of all possible combinations.
Essentially, these records are identical to a sideshot record.<br>

<p>Notice that the record from point 7 to 8 is set as a CL+AB
record. This tells the program that point 8 is the closing point
and that the angle from 7 to 8 is the closing angle. For traverse
adjustment, the closing reference point is 1 and the closure error
is the difference between point 1 and point 8. For angle balance,
the reference closing angle is 358d0'42" (178d0'42" + 180). The
angle balance error is the difference between this reference angle
and the angle from points 7 to 8.</p>

<p>Shown above is the resulting process report. The angle balance
had an error of 39 seconds which was divided among the 7 traverse
sides. The Compass Closure shows how each traverse point was
adjusted and then the resulting adjusted angles and distances.</p>

<p>Here is another layout of the last example that shows an
external backsight setup. In this case there are two known points.
Point 1 is the starting point and point 21 is the initial
backsight. The setup could also use a backsight azimuth (ie north
azimuth for example) instead of a backsight point number.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="03-0H223.bmp" align=
"bottom">
</p>

<p>The closing record setup has changed from the last example. In
this example, the shot from 7 to 8 is the closing shot with point 8
as the closing point. The closing reference point is still point 1.
The angle balance shot is from 8 to 9 and the reference angle is
from 1 to 21.</p>

<p>The traverse starts from the known point 1 and ends at the known
point 14. In this case there is no angle balance shot. The closing
shot is from 3 to 4 with point 4 being the closing point. Point 14
is the closing reference point.<br></p>
